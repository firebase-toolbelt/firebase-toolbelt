# Firebase Toolbelt
> A collection of firebase tools trusted by the tasking team.

Tasking is an application built using solely [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) as its backend.
We've been testing out it's capabilities since it's early days and we've grown confident in the way we use it to meet our ends.
Here we'll mantain a list of firebase related utilities we have developed and used in production, as well as other third party libraries we admire and have used as well.
